# 3D Tank Prototype â€“ OpenGL

This project is a complete prototype of a 3D tank built using C++ and OpenGL. It was designed as a foundational example of a simple 3D game element that could be integrated into larger gameplay systems or serve as a base for prototyping mechanics such as movement, rotation, shooting, and animation.

## ðŸŽ® Features

- Fully rendered 3D tank composed of:
  - Central body
  - Left and right treads (tracks)
  - Rotating cannon and turret base
- Simple texture mapping
- Modular structure for easy code updates and extensions
- Real-time rendering using GLUT and OpenGL
- Swappable assets (textures, scale, etc.)

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- C++
- OpenGL (Fixed-function pipeline)
- GLUT (for windowing and input)
- SOIL (for texture loading)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Just run the executable:

```bash
./bin/tank.exe
   ```
Or, for compile:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- C++ Compiler (g++, MinGW)
- OpenGL development libraries
- FreeGLUT
- GLEW
- SOIL (Simple OpenGL Image Library)

### Install the dependencies (Windows with MSYS2 MinGW)

1. Update the app:
   ```bash
   pacman -Syu
   ```
5. Then install:

   ```bash
   pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-freeglut mingw-w64-x86_64-glew mingw-w64-x86_64-soil
   ```

6. Compile in a terminal:

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp core/*.cpp render/*.cpp -o bin/tank.exe -IC:/msys64/mingw64/include -LC:/msys64/mingw64/lib -lfreeglut -lglew32 -lSOIL -lopengl32 -lglu32 ./bin/tank.exe
   ```

### Linux

1. Make sure the following packages are installed:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev libsoil-dev g++
   ```

2. Compile and run as above.

## ðŸ§­ Controls

- `Arrow keys` â€” Moves the camera and the turret
- `W / A / S / D` â€” Moves the tank
- `V` â€” Changes the perspective to 1st ou 3rd person
